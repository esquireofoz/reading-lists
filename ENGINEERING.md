## Blogs
  - [Brendan Gregg's Blog](https://www.brendangregg.com/blog/index.html) - good explanations of low-level systems performance insights and observability techniques and fundamentals
  - [Julia Evans' Blog](https://jvns.ca/) and [associated zines](https://wizardzines.com/) - good breakdowns of low-level systems concepts and an emphasis on protocols
  - [CNCF (Cloud Native Computing Foundation) Project Blog Posts](https://www.cncf.io/blog/) - warning: this has a lot of content, but is good for getting a view into updates across the broad surface area which is the [CNCF landscape](https://landscape.cncf.io/)
